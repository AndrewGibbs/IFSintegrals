# IFSintegrals

This documentation explains basic usage of the Julia package ```IFSintegrals```. This package is designed to approximate integrals and solve integral equations on fractals.

There is no generally accepted definition of the word _fractal_. Here we consider self-similar sets, which can be described as the attractor of an iterated function system, consisting of a set of affine contraction maps.


## Installation:
To install, type the following into Julia:

`using Pkg`

`Pkg.add("https://github.com/AndrewGibbs/IFSintegrals.git")`
