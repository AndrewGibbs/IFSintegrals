# IFSintegrals

This documentation explains basic usage of the Julia package ```IFSintegrals```. This package is designed to approximate integrals and solve integral equations on fractals.

There is no generally accepted definition of the word _fractal_. Here we consider self-similar sets, which can be described as the [attractor of an iterated function system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system), consisting of a set of affine contraction maps.
